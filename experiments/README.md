## analyse_atm_weekly
- [x] Read the files into a proper columnar structure
- [x] For each minute, have access to VIX, ATM Strikes and Straddle price
- [ ] Summarise the Vix, Day -> ATM Straddle Open to Close prices (preferably in a CSV)
- [ ] Massage 1 minute Nifty data to 5 minute aggregates and export it to JSON for later consumption for swing highs and lows. Exporting it to JSON also allows us to build a page with TV Lightweight charts for manual analysis later on if needed.
